> **Note:** This tutorial assumes a GPU is available. Install GPU dependencies with `pip install autogluon[tabarena]`.

Summary: This tutorial demonstrates implementing foundation models for tabular data using AutoGluon. It covers three key models: Mitra (for small datasets with zero-shot and fine-tuning capabilities), TabICL (leveraging in-context learning for limited data), and TabPFNv2 (utilizing prior knowledge for small datasets). The code shows how to prepare data, train individual models for classification and regression tasks, and create ensembles combining multiple foundation models. Developers can learn to implement these specialized tabular models with different configurations, evaluate their performance, and handle both classification and regression problems with small to medium-sized datasets.

## Installation

First, let's install AutoGluon with support for foundational models:


```python
# Individual model installations:
!pip install uv
!uv pip install autogluon.tabular[mitra,tabarena]   # For Mitra
!uv pip install autogluon.tabular[tabicl,tabarena]   # For TabICL
!uv pip install autogluon.tabular[tabpfn,tabarena]   # For TabPFNv2

```


```python
import pandas as pd
from autogluon.tabular import TabularDataset, TabularPredictor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine, fetch_california_housing
```

## Example Data

For this tutorial, we'll demonstrate the foundational models on three different datasets to showcase their versatility:

1. **Wine Dataset** (Multi-class Classification) - Medium-sized dataset for comparing model performance
3. **California Housing** (Regression) - Regression dataset

Let's load and prepare these datasets:


```python
# Load datasets

# 1. Wine (Multi-class Classification)
wine_data = load_wine()
wine_df = pd.DataFrame(wine_data.data, columns=wine_data.feature_names)
wine_df['target'] = wine_data.target

# 2. California Housing (Regression)
housing_data = fetch_california_housing()
housing_df = pd.DataFrame(housing_data.data, columns=housing_data.feature_names)
housing_df['target'] = housing_data.target

print("Dataset shapes:")
print(f"Wine: {wine_df.shape}")
print(f"California Housing: {housing_df.shape}")
```

## Create Train/Test Splits

Let's create train/test splits for our datasets:


```python
# Create train/test splits (80/20)
wine_train, wine_test = train_test_split(wine_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=wine_df['target'])
housing_train, housing_test = train_test_split(housing_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print("Training set sizes:")
print(f"Wine: {len(wine_train)} samples")
print(f"Housing: {len(housing_train)} samples")

# Convert to TabularDataset
wine_train_data = TabularDataset(wine_train)
wine_test_data = TabularDataset(wine_test)
housing_train_data = TabularDataset(housing_train)
housing_test_data = TabularDataset(housing_test)
```

## 1. Mitra: AutoGluon's Tabular Foundation Model

[Mitra](https://huggingface.co/autogluon/mitra-classifier) is a new state-of-the-art tabular foundation model developed by the AutoGluon team, natively supported in AutoGluon with just three lines of code via `predictor.fit())`. Built on the in-context learning paradigm and pretrained exclusively on synthetic data, Mitra introduces a principled pretraining approach by carefully selecting and mixing diverse synthetic priors to promote robust generalization across a wide range of real-world tabular datasets.

ðŸ“Š **Mitra achieves state-of-the-art performance** on major benchmarks including TabRepo, TabZilla, AMLB, and TabArena, especially excelling on small tabular datasets with fewer than 5,000 samples and 100 features, for both classification and regression tasks.

ðŸ§  **Mitra supports both zero-shot and fine-tuning modes** and runs seamlessly on both GPU and CPU. Its weights are fully open-sourced under the Apache-2.0 license, making it a privacy-conscious and production-ready solution for enterprises concerned about data sharing and hosting.

### Using Mitra for Classification


```python
# Create predictor with Mitra
print("Training Mitra classifier on classification dataset...")
mitra_predictor = TabularPredictor(label='target')
mitra_predictor.fit(
    wine_train_data,
   )

print("\nMitra training completed!")
```

## Evaluate Mitra Performance


```python
# Make predictions
mitra_predictions = mitra_predictor.predict(wine_test_data)
print("Sample Mitra predictions:")
print(mitra_predictions.head(10))

# Show prediction probabilities for first few samples
mitra_predictions = mitra_predictor.predict_proba(wine_test_data)
print(mitra_predictions.head())

# Show model leaderboard
print("\nMitra Model Leaderboard:")
mitra_predictor.leaderboard(wine_test_data)

```

## Finetuning with Mitra


```python
mitra_predictor_ft = TabularPredictor(label='target')
mitra_predictor_ft.fit(
    wine_train_data,
    time_limit=120,  # 2 minutes
   )

print("\nMitra fine-tuning completed!")
```

## Evaluating Fine-tuned Mitra Performance


```python

# Show model leaderboard
print("\nMitra Model Leaderboard:")
mitra_predictor_ft.leaderboard(wine_test_data)

```

## Using Mitra for Regression


```python

# Create predictor with Mitra for regression
print("Training Mitra regressor on California Housing dataset...")
mitra_reg_predictor = TabularPredictor(
    label='target',
    path='./mitra_regressor_model',
    problem_type='regression'
)
mitra_reg_predictor.fit(
    housing_train_data.sample(1000), # sample 1000 rows
)

# Evaluate regression performance
mitra_reg_predictor.leaderboard(housing_test_data)

```

## 2. TabICL: In-Context Learning for Tabular Data

**TabICL** ("**Tab**ular **I**n-**C**ontext **L**earning") is a foundational model designed specifically for in-context learning on large tabular datasets.

**Paper**: ["TabICL: A Tabular Foundation Model for In-Context Learning on Large Data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05564)  
**Authors**: Jingang Qu, David HolzmÃ¼ller, GaÃ«l Varoquaux, Marine Le Morvan  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl

TabICL leverages transformer architecture with in-context learning capabilities, making it particularly effective for scenarios where you have limited training data but access to related examples.


```python
# Train TabICL on dataset
print("Training TabICL on wine dataset...")
tabicl_predictor = TabularPredictor(
    label='target',
    path='./tabicl_model'
)
tabicl_predictor.fit(
    wine_train_data,
)

# Show prediction probabilities for first few samples
tabicl_predictions = tabicl_predictor.predict_proba(wine_test_data)
print(tabicl_predictions.head())

# Show TabICL leaderboard
print("\nTabICL Model Details:")
tabicl_predictor.leaderboard(wine_test_data)
```

## 3. TabPFNv2: Prior-Fitted Networks

**TabPFNv2** ("**Tab**ular **P**rior-**F**itted **N**etworks **v2**") is designed for accurate predictions on small tabular datasets by using prior-fitted network architectures.

**Paper**: ["Accurate predictions on small data with a tabular foundation model"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08328-6)  
**Authors**: Noah Hollmann, Samuel MÃ¼ller, Lennart Purucker, Arjun Krishnakumar, Max KÃ¶rfer, Shi Bin Hoo, Robin Tibor Schirrmeister & Frank Hutter  
**GitHub**: https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN

TabPFNv2 excels on small datasets (< 10,000 samples) by leveraging prior knowledge encoded in the network architecture.


```python
# Train TabPFNv2 on Wine dataset (perfect size for TabPFNv2)
print("Training TabPFNv2 on Wine dataset...")
tabpfnv2_predictor = TabularPredictor(
    label='target',
    path='./tabpfnv2_model'
)
tabpfnv2_predictor.fit(
    wine_train_data,
)

# Show prediction probabilities for first few samples
tabpfnv2_predictions = tabpfnv2_predictor.predict_proba(wine_test_data)
print(tabpfnv2_predictions.head())


tabpfnv2_predictor.leaderboard(wine_test_data)
```

## Advanced Usage: Combining Multiple Foundational Models

AutoGluon allows you to combine multiple foundational models in a single predictor for enhanced performance through model stacking and ensembling:


```python
# Configure multiple foundational models together
multi_foundation_config = {
    'MITRA': {
        'fine_tune': True,
        'fine_tune_steps': 10
    },
    'TABPFNV2': {},
    'TABICL': {},
}

print("Training ensemble of foundational models...")
ensemble_predictor = TabularPredictor(
    label='target',
    path='./ensemble_foundation_model'
).fit(
        wine_train_data,
        time_limit=300,  # More time for multiple models
    )

# Evaluate ensemble performance
ensemble_predictor.leaderboard(wine_test_data)

```
