Summary: This tutorial explains AutoGluon's automatic feature engineering capabilities for tabular data. It covers type-specific processing: numerical columns remain unchanged, categorical columns are integer-encoded, datetime columns are converted to numerical values with extracted temporal features (year, month, day, weekday), and text columns use either n-gram encoding or Transformer networks with MultiModal. The tutorial demonstrates how to implement custom feature generation pipelines using PipelineFeatureGenerator, CategoryFeatureGenerator, and IdentityFeatureGenerator classes, with examples of limiting categorical values and handling specific data types. It also addresses missing value handling and provides tips for customizing the feature engineering process.

```
predictor = TabularPredictor(label='class', problem_type='multiclass').fit(train_data)
```


## Automatic Feature Engineering ##

## Numerical Columns ##

Numeric columns, both integer and floating point, currently have no automated feature engineering.

## Categorical Columns ##

Since many downstream models require categories to be encoded as integers, each categorical feature is mapped to monotonically increasing integers.

## Datetime Columns ##

Columns recognised as datetime, are converted into several features:

- a numerical Pandas datetime.  Note this has maximum and minimum values specified at [pandas.Timestamp.min](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.min.html) and [pandas.Timestamp.max](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Timestamp.min.html) respectively, which may affect extremely dates very far into the future or past.
- several extracted columns, the default is `[year, month, day, dayofweek]`.  This is configrable via the [DatetimeFeatureGenerator](../../api/autogluon.features.rst)

Note that missing, invalid and out-of-range features generated by the above logic will be converted to the mean value across all valid rows.


## Text Columns ##

If the [MultiModal](tabular-multimodal.ipynb) option is enabled, then text columns are processed using a full Transformer neural network model with pretrained NLP models.

Otherwise, they are processed in two more simple ways:

- an n-gram feature generator extracts n-grams (short strings) from the text feature, adding many additional columns, one for each n-gram feature.  These columns are 'n-hot' encoded, containing 1 or more if the original feature contains the n-gram 1 or more times, and 0 otherwise.  By default, all text columns are concatenated before applying this stage, and the n-grams are individual words, not substrings of words.  You can configure this via the [TextNgramFeatureGenerator](../../api/autogluon.features.rst) class. The n-gram generation is done in `generators/text_ngram.py`
- Some additional numerical features are calculated, such as word counts, character counts, proportion of uppercase characters, etc.  This is configurable via the [TextSpecialFeatureGenerator](../../api/autogluon.features.rst).  This is done in `generators/text_special.py`

## Additional Processing ##

- Columns containing only 1 value are dropped before passing to models.
- Columns containing duplicates of other columns are removed before passing to models.

## Feature Engineering Example ##

By default a feature generator called [AutoMLPipelineFeatureGenerator](../../api/autogluon.features.rst) is used.  Let's see this in action.  We'll create a dataframe containing a floating point column, an integer column, a datetime column,  a categorical column.  We'll first take a look at the raw data we created.


```python
!pip install autogluon.tabular[all,tabarena]

```


```python
from autogluon.tabular import TabularDataset, TabularPredictor
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from datetime import datetime

x, y = make_regression(n_samples = 100,n_features = 5,n_targets = 1, random_state = 1)
dfx = pd.DataFrame(x, columns=['A','B','C','D','E'])
dfy = pd.DataFrame(y, columns=['label'])

# Create an integer column, a datetime column, a categorical column and a string column to demonstrate how they are processed.
dfx['B'] = (dfx['B']).astype(int)
dfx['C'] = datetime(2000,1,1) + pd.to_timedelta(dfx['C'].astype(int), unit='D')
dfx['D'] = pd.cut(dfx['D'] * 10, [-np.inf,-5,0,5,np.inf],labels=['v','w','x','y'])
dfx['E'] = pd.Series(list(' '.join(random.choice(["abc", "d", "ef", "ghi", "jkl"]) for i in range(4)) for j in range(100)))
dataset=TabularDataset(dfx)
print(dfx)
```

Now let's call the default feature generator AutoMLPipeLineFeatureGenerator with no parameters and see what it does.


```python
from autogluon.features.generators import AutoMLPipelineFeatureGenerator
auto_ml_pipeline_feature_generator = AutoMLPipelineFeatureGenerator()
auto_ml_pipeline_feature_generator.fit_transform(X=dfx)
```

We can see that:

- The floating point and integer columns 'A' and 'B' are unchanged.
- The datetime column 'C' has been converted to a raw value (in nanoseconds), as well as parsed into additional columns for the year, month, day and dayofweek.
- The string categorical column 'D' has been mapped 1:1 to integers - a lot of models only accept numerical input.
- The freeform text column has been mapped into some summary features ('char_count' etc) as well as a N-hot matrix saying whether each text contained each word.

To get more details, we should call the pipeline as part of `TabularPredictor.fit()`.  We need to combine the `dfx` and `dfy` DataFrames since fit() expects a single dataframe.


```python
df = pd.concat([dfx, dfy], axis=1)
predictor = TabularPredictor(label='label')
predictor.fit(df, hyperparameters={'GBM' : {}}, feature_generator=auto_ml_pipeline_feature_generator)
```

Reading the output, note that:

- the string-categorical column 'D', despite being mapped to integers, is still recognised as categorical. 
- the integer column 'B' has not been identified as categorical, even though it only has a few unique values:


```python
print(len(set(dfx['B'])))
```

To mark it as categorical, we can explicitly mark it as categorical in the original dataframe:


```python
dfx["B"] = dfx["B"].astype("category")
auto_ml_pipeline_feature_generator = AutoMLPipelineFeatureGenerator()
auto_ml_pipeline_feature_generator.fit_transform(X=dfx)
```

## Missing Value Handling ##
To illustrate missing value handling, let's set the first row to all NaNs:


```python
dfx.iloc[0] = np.nan
dfx.head()
```

Now if we reprocess:


```python
auto_ml_pipeline_feature_generator = AutoMLPipelineFeatureGenerator()
auto_ml_pipeline_feature_generator.fit_transform(X=dfx)
```

We see that the floating point, integer, categorical and text fields 'A', 'B', 'D', and 'E' have retained the NaNs, but the datetime column 'C' has been set to the mean of the non-NaN values.


## Customization of Feature Engineering ##
To customize your feature generation pipeline, it is recommended to call [PipelineFeatureGenerator](../../api/autogluon.features.rst), passing in non-default parameters to other feature generators as required.  For example, if we think downstream models would benefit from removing rare categorical values and replacing with NaN, we can supply the parameter maximum_num_cat to CategoryFeatureGenerator, as below:


```python
from autogluon.features.generators import PipelineFeatureGenerator, CategoryFeatureGenerator, IdentityFeatureGenerator
from autogluon.common.features.types import R_INT, R_FLOAT
mypipeline = PipelineFeatureGenerator(
    generators = [[        
        CategoryFeatureGenerator(maximum_num_cat=10),  # Overridden from default.
        IdentityFeatureGenerator(infer_features_in_args=dict(valid_raw_types=[R_INT, R_FLOAT])),
    ]]
)
```

If we then dump out the transformed data, we can see that all columns have been converted to numeric, because that's what most models require, and the rare categorical values have been replaced with NaN:


```python
mypipeline.fit_transform(X=dfx)
```
